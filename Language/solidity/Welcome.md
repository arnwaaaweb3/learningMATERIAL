# Hello, dear Warrior! ⚔️

Welcome to the world of **Solidity**!

This is my personal notes to help you learn Solidity.  
Here, I’m documenting **every tiniest concept** about Solidity — as clearly and honestly as I can.

> **P.S**  
> Oh yeah, your brain is going to be mushed just like mine (lol 😄)

Don’t worry.  
Here, I’m going to explain everything **step by step**, and I really hope it’s not scarier than I imagine.

Because at the time I’m writing this note,  
**I’m also a Solidity normie.**

## What You Need Before Learning Solidity

### 1. A Curious Mind 🧠
Always be hungry and **question everything**, even things you think you already understand.

Don’t act like you know something —  
that mindset will blur your learning process.

---

### 2. Grit and Endurance 💪
I’m not coming from a Computer Science background,  
so learning Solidity sometimes feels **impossible** for me.

If you’re in the same shoes as I am, don’t worry — **you can do it**.

What you need to promise me is this:
- Have grit
- Have endurance

Some concepts may sound too sophisticated for your brain at first.  
That’s normal.

Don’t give up.  
Take your time, even if your progress feels as slow as a snail 🐌.

And please, don’t forget to enjoy your real life too.  
You deserve to **learn and have fun** at the same time.

### 3. Patience 🕰️
Learning is a process, and it takes time.

Don't expect yourself to be an expert in:
- Six months
- One year

The field is **way broader than you think**.  
So remember — patience is the key.

---

### 4. Consistency 🔁
Learning Solidity (at least for me) is a **commitment**.

Like a marriage, I’m committed to learning every day —  
even if it’s just a tiny bit.

So you should be too.

I hope I won’t abandon what I’m starting right now.  
Because consistency is the real key — and **you can’t rush greatness**.

## That’s All ✨

Have fun,  
**Nawa**
