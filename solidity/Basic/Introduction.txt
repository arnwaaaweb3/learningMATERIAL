# Basic Questions

Q: What is a blockchain?
     A: Think of a blockchain as a digital record book that is copied and shared across many computers around the world. 
          Because every participant has a copy, no single person or authority can change the records, making it extremely secure and trustworthy.

Q: What is a ledger?
     A: A ledger is simply the name for that digital record book. 
          It contains a complete history of all the transactions that have ever happened on the network.

Q: How does a blockchain work?
     A: It works by bundling new data (like transactions) into a "block." 
          This block is cryptographically sealed and then validated by the network's participants. 
          Once validated, this new block is permanently attached to the end of the previous block, creating a continuous, unbroken "chain" of records.

Q: How secure is a blockchain?
      A: It’s highly secure because of two things: 
          1. Cryptography
          2. Distribution. 
               Every new block is linked to the old one using a unique cryptographic hash. 
               If someone tries to change data in an old block, its signature changes, which instantly breaks the link to every block that followed. 
               Since everyone in the network has a copy, the fake block is immediately noticed and rejected.

Q: How does the record-sharing (distribution) process work?
     A: When you send a transaction, it is first sent out (broadcasted) to the network and waits in a temporary holding area called the mempool.
          Special network participants (validators or miners) collect these waiting transactions and put them into a new block. 
          To agree on which block is the correct one, the network uses a Consensus Mechanism (a set of rules). 
          Once the new block is accepted by the consensus rules, it is shared with all other computers, and they all add a copy to their own ledger, keeping everything synchronized.

Q: What is Solidity?
     A: Solidity is the programming language used to write Smart Contract for Ethereum.
          It defines the rules and logic for how an agreement works, and then executes the code automatically when the terms are met, all without needing a third-party lawyer or banker.

Q: Is Solidity only for Ethereum?
     A: No, but it is EVM-native, meaning it was specifically built for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
          You can use Solidity on Ethereum, but also on any other blockchain that is compatible with the EVM (like Polygon or Avalanche C-Chain).

Q: What is EVM?
     A: Etherum Virtual Machine (EVM) is virtual machine that runs smart contracts within Ethereum protocol

Q: How does EVM work?
     A: EVM does these three essential things:
          1. It runs the bytecode of the smart contract, compiled from Solidity.
               Think of it as the "brain" or CPU of the smart contract.
          2. It manages the storage of the contract.
               All variables and data (mapping, uint, string, etc) are stored in storage, memory, or stack.
               and EVM is the one who manages the layout.
          3. It manages the cost of the gas fees.
               Every order and execution of the smart contract is charged a certain amount of gas.
               For example:
                   add --> cheap gas fees
                   sstore (write to storage) --> expensive gas fees
                   kkecak256 --> kinda expensive
                   etc.
          For more information, please refer to EVM.txt

Q: In Solidity, what is the difference between a storage and a memory?
     A: Storage is permanent while memory is temporary.
          Imagine storage as a hard-disk in a computer.
          Storage is having an expensive gas fees.
          This is the one that goes into the blockchain after the transaction is completed.
               For example:
               string public name; // STORAGE
          For more information, please refer to the storage folder.

# Basic Notes

- Solidity often called as Turing Complete:
          It means that it  can solve any computation problem, and any calculation.

- A contract is a collection of functions and data ()
