# EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
===========================

Let's talk about the EVM
    To make it simple, EVM is a virtual computer machine that executes the Ethereum's smart contract.
    Imagine that EVM is a "super standard computer" that runs in every Ethereum's node.
    These nodes are executing the same instructions, same rules, to make the result identical.

So, what does EVM do?
    There's three main function that EVM does:
        1. EVM runs the bytecode of the smart contract.
            Solidity compiled the smart contract into bytecode
            Then, EVM reads and executes the bytecode like a computer.
            And here, every instruction in EVM are required gas fee.
            So, to be short, EVM is the CPU for the blockchain.
        2. Managing storage.
            All variables in smart contract like (mapping, uint, int, string, etc) are saved in:
                - Storage: This is permanent and expensive.
                - Memory: This is temporary and cheap.
                - Stack: This is the name of stacked LIFO data 
            EVM here is the mastermind behind all of these layouts
        3. Gas fees.
            Every instruction in EVM costs a gas fee.
            For example:
                   add --> cheap gas fees
                   sstore (write to storage) --> expensive gas fees
                   kkecak256 --> kinda expensive
                   etc.
        
How does EVM work? (Step-by-step)
    Imagine you're calling the "transfer()" in ERC-20 smart contract.
        1. You're sending some amount of tokens to someone (transfer).
