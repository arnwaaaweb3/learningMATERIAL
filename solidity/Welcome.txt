Hello, dear Warrior!
========================

Welcome to the world of Solidity!
This is my notes for you to learn about Solidity.
And here, i'm documenting every tiniest concepts about Solidity.

--------------------------------------------------
P.S Oh yeah, your brain is going to mushed just like mine (lol :D)
--------------------------------------------------

Don't worry, Here i'm going to explain everything in detail.
And i do hope it's not scarier than i think! 
Because by the time i'm writing this note, i'm also a normie in Solidity.

---------------------------------------------------

What you need to have before you start learning this Solidity:
    1. A Curious Mind: 
        Always be hungry and ask everything, even the things that you think you already understand.
        Don't act like you know something, because it will blur your learning process.
    2. Grit and Endurance:
        I'm not coming from a Computer Science background, so learning this is feels impossible for me.
        If you're in the same shoes as i am, don't worry! You can do it!
        What you need to promise me is, you need to have a grit and endurance.
        Some learning concepts may sounds too sophisticated for your brain to take into.
        But, don't give up. 
        Just take your time to understand things, even if it's slowly like a snail steps.
        And please don't forget to have fun too with your real life.
        You deserve to learn and having fun too.
    3. Patience:
        Learning is a process and it takes time.
        Don't expect to be an expert in just six months or a year.
        The field is very wide more than you think.
        So, patience is the key.
    4. Consistency:
        Learning, especially Solidity for me is a commitment.
        Like a marriage, i'm committed to learn this everyday, even if just a little for a day.
        So, you should be too.
        I hope i didn't expect myself to not finishing what i'm starting right now.
        Consistency is the key, and you can't rush greatness.

---------------------------------------------------
That's all!
Have fun,
Nawa.
